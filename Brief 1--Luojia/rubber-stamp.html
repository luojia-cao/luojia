        <p> &nbsp Rubber is the raw materials of rubber stamps. The rubber also has different sizes and shapes for different patterns. You can also cut down the rubber when finishing engraving. Besides, rubbers have different hardness. As beginners, I chose rubber stamps with higher hardness in order to practise controlling lines.</p>
